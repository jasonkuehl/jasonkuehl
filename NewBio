I’m currently a Manager of Infrastructure and Engineering at Rue Gilt Groupe, My background is in data center operations, and I changed 
to the cloud when I moved to Boston. However during that time I moved into a hybrid role I consider myself an expert in data center and cloud operations, 
as I help bridge the gap between these two worlds and offer solutions for both.

My skills and experiences with networking, Wreless, OnPrem Servers , Security, Infra as Code, project management, cloud platforms, and data centers.
I’m also a major advocate for any open-source projects. LIbreNMS has been my goto for on site network inforation gathering and reporting.

In my spare time, I enjoy making props for cosplay, managing his own private data center (Homelab), as well as building/fabrications projects out of my Studio/Workshop. 
If you like custom BBQ smokers, man so I have a project for you, see my Tiktoc below.
