<h4>Hello! I'm Jason Kuehl<h4>
<h4>Maker, Cosplayer, and Infra Guy  <h4>
</h4>Iâ€™m currently a Manager of Infrastructure and Engineering at Rue Gilt Groupe, with previous experience with SessionM, Virgin Pulse, Airadigm, and others. My background is in data center operations, and I changed </h4>to the cloud when I moved to Boston. I consider myself an expert in data center and cloud operations, as I can bridge the gap between these two worlds and offer solutions for both.</h4>
</h4>My skills and experiences are all information technology-related, including networking, Wreless, Ops, Security, Infra as Code, project management, cloud platforms, and data centers.</h4>
</h4>Iâ€™m also a major advocate for any open-source projects. LIbreNMS is my favorite.</h4>
</h4>In my spare time, I enjoy making props for cosplay, managing his own private data center, as well as building/fabrications projects out of my workshop.</h4>
