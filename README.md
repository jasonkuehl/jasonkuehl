<h4>Hello! I'm Jason Kuehl<h4>
<h4>Maker, Cosplayer, and Infra Guy  <h4>
<p>-----------------------------------</p>
<h5>I‚Äôm currently a Principal Infrastructure Engineer at Rue Gilt Groupe, with previous experience with SessionM, Virgin Pulse, Airadigm, and others. My background is in data center operations, and I changed to the cloud when I moved to Boston. I consider myself an expert in data center and cloud operations, as I can bridge the gap between these two worlds and offer solutions for both.
My skills and experiences are all information technology-related, including networking, Wreless, Ops, Security, Infra as Code, project management, cloud platforms, and data centers.
I‚Äôm also a major advocate for any open-source projects. Nextcloud is my favorite.
In my spare time, I enjoy making props for cosplay, managing his own private data center, as well as building/fabrications projects out of my workshop.
