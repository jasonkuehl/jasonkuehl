<br>Hello! I'm Jason Kuehl
<br>Maker, Cosplayer, and Infra Guy  </h5>

<h5><br>Iâ€™m currently a Principal Infrastructure Engineer at Rue Gilt Groupe, with previous experience with SessionM, Virgin Pulse, Airadigm, and others. My background is in data center operations, and I changed to the cloud when I moved to Boston. I consider myself an expert in data center and cloud operations, as I can bridge the gap between these two worlds and offer solutions for both.
 
My skills and experiences are all information technology-related, including networking, Wireless, Ops, Security, Infra as Code, project management, cloud platforms, and data centers.
 
Iâ€™m also a major advocate for any open-source projects. Nextcloud is my favorite.
 
In my spare time, I enjoy making props for cosplay, managing his own private data center, as well as building/fabrications projects out of my workshop.
